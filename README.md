### Hi there 👋

I'm Vallat, the creator and main developer of [Ashen sky](https://github.com/Vallat/Ashen-Sky)☢️ - hardcore 2D MMO inspired by Roadside Picnic novel

I also do some code and code reviews for [@ss220](https://github.com/ss220-space) - biggest russian community of [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com)

I really like to solve complex code tasks and currently I'm learning C#, though I don't mind going deep into C++ or Rust

#### My university projects:
- Code [compiler](https://github.com/Vallat/custom_compiler) written in C++
- Simple [calculator](https://github.com/Vallat/calculator) on C#
- And a [parser](https://github.com/Vallat/mirapolis-parser) for university lections so that I have more free time for coding 😋
